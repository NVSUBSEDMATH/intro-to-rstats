# What is R?

![](images/R1.png){fig-align="center"}

## Introduction to R

::: incremental
-   [R](www.r-project.org) was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and is currently developed by the R Development Core Team.

-   R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible.
:::

## Introduction to R

-   R provides an Open Source route to participation in research in statistical methodology.

::: incremental
-   One of R's strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed.
:::

## The R Environment

R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. It includes

::: incremental
-   an effective data handling and storage facility,

-   a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,

-   a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,
:::

## The R Environment

R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. It includes

-   graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and

::: incremental
-   a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.
:::

## The R Environment

-   The term "environment" is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools.

::: incremental
-   R is designed around a true computer language, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions.
:::

## The R Environment

-   Many users think of R as a statistics system. R is more of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics. Currently, the CRAN package repository features 19,728 available packages.

# What is RStudio (Posit)?

## Introduction to RStudio

[posit](https://posit.co/): The open source data science company.

[RSTUDIO IDE](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/): The most trusted IDE for open source data science.

# What is R and RStudio?

## 

-   R is a statistical programming language.

-   RStudio is a convenient interface for R (an integrated development environment, IDE).
